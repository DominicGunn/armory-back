## Usage

### Fire and forget

Starts three docker containers, fetch, server, and db.

```
./go.sh serve
```

### Local development

The developer experience is kind of shitty at the moment. You need to start the node servers manually in watch mode, as well as hook up a database. Currently there isn't an automated way to do this - so install `mysql 3.6`, using docker or directly on your host, and then modify the `./environment/env_config.js` DEV object.

### Copy config

```
./go.sh copy
```

### Api server

```
cd ./server
npm install
gulp test:unit:auto
```

## Fetch server

```
cd ./gw2-fetch
npm install
npm test
```
